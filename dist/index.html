			<h1>Evaluation: Effect of uncertainty visualization in clinical decision making</h1>

			<p>
				
				You are being invited to participate in a research study titled effect of white matter uncertainty visualization in neurosurgical decision making. 
				This study is being done by a PhD candidate, Faizan Siddiqui from the TU Delft, Department of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer 
				Science. 
				
				<br>
				<br>
The purpose of this research study is to analyze whether the uncertainty visualization in fiber tracking affects decision-making in clinical workflow. 
The outcome of this evaluation will be anonymously included in a paper. We will be providing several clinical cases of tumor resection surgery and present fiber 
tracking results with and without uncertainty information via this interactive web-tool. We then ask you to answer questions based on the given results.
<br>
